## Prologue: The Wound Beneath

### Page One

> Long ago, something fell from the sky and buried itself beneath Valdris.
>
> Not a meteor. Not a god. Something that dreams in geometries
> that rewrite what touches them.
>
> The kingdom did not fall in a single night.
> It was edited, slowly, over generations.
>
> The dungeon is not a place that was built.
> It is a wound. A seam where reality frays.
>
> Now the edits are accelerating.

### Page Two

> You are not here for gold or glory.
>
> Some who descend return—but without their meaning.
> They stagger out empty-eyed, wordless, their names
> vanishing from records within days.
>
> No one returns with a story that holds.

*Last week, your mother called you by a different name.*

*Not as a mistake—like she had never known any other.*

*In the town registry, your birth record has a thin blank line where your surname should be. The clerk smiles and asks if you are feeling well.*

*A storm rolls over the hills that night.*

*In the morning, your house key fits your door… and also your neighbor's. Your neighbor insists it has always been that way.*

*At noon, the palace bell rings twice—two coronations, separated by a breath. The city applauds both.*

*By evening, your brother's portrait is still on the mantle. But no one can remember who the boy is.*

*That is when you understand: the Field is no longer underground.*

*It is choosing what the world has always been.*

---

> Yet sky-touched artifacts keep leaking to the surface:
> proof without context, treasures that remember nothing.
>
> You descend because the Field is rewriting your home.
> Your monarch speaks with two voices now.
> Your family tree has branches that never existed.
>
> If you do not find the source and stabilize it,
> everyone you love will be replaced.
>
> Or worse: they will have always been someone else.

## The Skyfall Seed

### What Fell

Centuries ago, during a storm that lasted seven days, something descended through the clouds above Valdris. The histories call it many things: the Star-Heart, the Dreaming Stone, the Skyfall Seed. None of these names are correct. Names imply understanding.

What fell was not an object but a *field*—a localized region where reality follows different rules. The physical "seed" at its center is merely the densest point of an influence that extends outward through stone, through water, through *meaning itself*.

### The Field

The Field does not invade. It *edits*.

Where the Field touches, legitimacy becomes fluid. Authority can be rewritten. A king may wake to find his bloodline contains ancestors who never lived—and no one remembers otherwise. Documents change. Memories shift. The Field does not create lies; it makes new truths.

The dungeon beneath Valdris is not a structure. It is the Field's geography—reality folded into layers, each layer a pocket where the edits have crystallized into stable (if nightmarish) forms. The corridors between pockets are seam lines, thinner regions where the Field's grip is weaker.

### Rules of the Field

The Field is not omnipotent. It operates under constraints that make survival—and resistance—possible:

- **It requires anchors.** The Field spreads through symbols of legitimate authority: crowns, seals, oaths, records, bloodlines. Without an anchor, it cannot edit.
- **It edits consensus, not physics.** The Field changes what is *agreed upon*, not raw matter. A stone is a stone. But who *owns* the stone, who *named* the stone, what the stone *means*—these can be rewritten.
- **It cannot rewrite the unwitnessed.** Events that leave no record, no memory, no trace are immune. This is why delvers matter—and why the Field consumes their stories on the way out. *Artifacts are witnesses. They carry edits into the surface world and make them harder to deny.*
- **Storm pulses accelerate edits.** When lightning strikes the fault lines above the Seed, the Field *surges*. Major rewrites happen during storms.
- **Seams are low-signal corridors.** The passages between pockets are where the Field's grip is thinnest. Travel is possible because the seams are not yet fully written.
- **Contradictions can coexist.** The Field does not resolve paradoxes; it makes them *both true*. Two histories, two kings, two versions—all equally real until one is witnessed more than the other.

Understanding these rules will not save you. But it may help you know *when* you are being edited.

### How It Spreads

The Field spreads through *narrative substitution*. It anchors itself to symbols of legitimate authority—crowns, bloodlines, oaths, seals. Once anchored, it can edit the meaning of those symbols, and everyone who believes in them changes with the edit.

Valdris's monarchy is the primary anchor. The Field has been slowly rewriting the royal lineage, inserting phantom ancestors, duplicating heirs, creating contradictory succession claims. Each edit weakens the membrane between the surface and the pockets below.

Storms accelerate the process. When lightning strikes the old fault lines above the mines, the Field *pulses*, and the surface world updates to match whatever the Seed is dreaming.

### What Leaks Upward

Despite the danger, people keep descending. Why?

Because artifacts escape. Weapons with impossible metallurgy. Armor that remembers being worn by people who never existed. Scrolls written in languages that *become* readable the longer you study them.

These sky-touched relics are proof that something real exists below—something that can be *retrieved*. The tragedy is that no retriever returns with a coherent account of where they found it, or how. The Field takes the context and leaves only the object.

**Known Sky-Touched Artifacts:**

| Artifact | Description | Cost |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **The Duplicate Seal** | A royal stamp that creates a second impression during storms—one on the document, one somewhere else. Both authentic. | Each use teaches the Field a new signature; the next decree it writes will sound more convincing than the last. |
| **Crown-Splinter** | A fragment of regalia that causes viewers to remember two versions of the same event, equally vivid. | The longer you hold it, the harder it becomes to prove which version hurt you. |
| **Woundglass Shard** | A mirror fragment that shows rooms that don't exist in its reflection—until you enter them. | Each time you step into what it shows, something real elsewhere is "made room" for. |
| **Ledger of the Unborn** | A book that adds names to genealogies. The people appear within weeks, insisting they've always existed. | A new name pushes an old one out; someone living becomes harder to remember each time the ink dries. |
| **Torch of Borrowed Hours** | Burns time instead of oil. While lit, aging stops for the holder—but continues somewhere else. | The hours are not free; the debt comes due in someone you love, at a moment you cannot choose. |
| **Chain-Link of Stasis** | A single link from an unknown chain. Whatever it touches slows. Whatever it binds stops. | Stasis spreads by sympathy—freeze one thing long enough, and nearby lives begin to lose their future tense. |
| **The Warden's Key** | Opens locks that shouldn't exist. The rooms behind them contain things that were never locked away. | Every door it opens convinces the dungeon there should have been a door there all along. |
| **Oathstone** | A smooth rock that records spoken promises. Breaking an oath recorded on it erases the oathbreaker from one person's memory. | The stone is hungry for vows; each promise taken makes the next break erase you from more than one mind. |

These artifacts surface during storms. Collectors hoard them. Scholars study them. No one knows which drawer or vault they will escape to next.

*The artifacts are not treasures. They are interfaces. They do not merely grant power—they increase the Field's vocabulary.*

## The Counterfeit Reign

The threat is not distant. It is happening now.

### Symptoms of the Rewrite

Those who study the surface effects of the Field have documented:

- **Duplicate Decrees**: Royal orders appearing with perfect seals, commanding excavation of sites that don't appear on any map—sites that *do* appear when workers arrive
- **Branching Genealogies**: Noble houses discovering extra branches in their family trees, complete with portraits, journals, and heirs who insist they've always existed
- **Storm Concordance**: Records rewriting faster during lightning storms; entire archives shifting overnight, with clerks remembering both versions
- **Narrative Erasure**: Dissenters who "never existed"—their names gone from records, their families unable to recall them, their belongings found in the possession of strangers who have "always owned them"

### The Counterfeit Throne

Somewhere in the palace, there are now two crowns. Both are genuine. Both have always been the only crown. The monarch wears one and speaks policy; something else wears the other and speaks excavation.

The nobles do not notice the contradiction. The Field has made it coherent for them.

### The Stakes

If the Field completes its anchor, Valdris will not be destroyed. It will be *replaced*—by a version of itself that has always served the Seed. The people will still exist. They will simply have always been something else.

> **The Field does not need to kill the king. It only needs the world to agree the king was never king at all.**

The only way to stop this is to descend to the source—the Star-Heart itself—and stabilize the seal that the ancient Valdrians attempted to place around it.

You are not here to destroy evil. You are here to make the dream *sleep again*.

---

## The Dungeon Depths

The dungeons beneath Valdris span eight distinct layers—not floors, but *pockets* of stabilized Field influence. Each pocket represents a different aspect of the Seed's dreaming mind.

The corridors between pockets are seam lines: thinner regions where reality is less thoroughly edited. These seams are where survivors sometimes escape (though never with their stories intact).

### Level 1: The Stone Dungeon

**Theme:** Ancient prison carved from solid rock
**The Field's Aspect:** MEMORY (what was locked away)

> "You descend into the Stone Dungeon. Ancient torches flicker with unnatural light."

*This layer is the Field's memory—a pocket where the Seed dreams of containment.* The upper reaches were once genuinely built: Valdris's first attempt to wall off the influence below. The Field *accepted* the prison metaphor and stabilized around it. Now the walls are real and unreal simultaneously. The torches burn without fuel because the Seed remembers that prisons should have light.

**Common Pockets:** Cell Blocks, Guard Corridors, Warden's Office, Execution Chambers, Record Vaults

**Monarchy Anchor:** The keys. Royal authority was once defined by who held the prison keys. The Field has been editing the meaning of "rightful jailer"—and through it, the meaning of "rightful ruler."

The seam to Level 2 runs along a fault line where ice crystals have begun to form in the stone.

**Warden:** The Goblin King

---

### Level 2: The Ice Cavern

**Theme:** Frozen caverns of eternal winter
**The Field's Aspect:** STASIS (what cannot change)

> "A biting cold grips you as you enter the Ice Cavern. Frost clings to every surface."

*This layer is the Field's stasis—a pocket where the Seed dreams of stillness.* The cold is not temperature; it is the *absence of change*. Things frozen here do not age, decay, or alter. The giant sealed within the ice has been breathing the same breath for three hundred years.

Someone is attempting to thaw the cavern. The Field does not resist—it simply makes the thaw *part of the stasis*, an eternal process that will never complete.

**Common Pockets:** Frozen Galleries, Ice Tombs, Crystal Grottos, Suspended Laboratories, The Breathing Chamber

**Monarchy Anchor:** The treaties. Ancient pacts sealed in ice—agreements that cannot be broken because they cannot change. The Field is editing which treaties were ever signed.

The seam to Level 3 opens where root systems have cracked through the ice.

**Warden:** The Frost Giant

---

### Level 3: The Forest Depths

**Theme:** Underground forest where nature has reclaimed all
**The Field's Aspect:** GROWTH (what consumes boundaries)

> "Roots and vines consume the walls. You have entered the Forest Depths, where nature claims all."

*This layer is the Field's growth—a pocket where the Seed dreams of expansion without limit.* The forest is not plants. It is *architecture* reimagined as organism. Walls become trunks. Corridors become root systems. The boundary between structure and growth dissolves. Everything here consumes its boundaries and becomes something larger.

The Spider Queen was human once—a druid who sought to contain the forest. The Field edited her into its gardener. She believes she is still fighting it.

**Common Pockets:** Root Warrens, Canopy Halls, Webbed Gardens, The Nursery, Digestion Chambers

**Monarchy Anchor:** The family trees. Genealogies literally grow here—branching, grafting, sprouting phantom lineages. The Field cultivates succession crises.

The seam to Level 4 descends through volcanic vents where the roots have charred.

**Warden:** The Spider Queen

---

### Level 4: The Volcanic Depths

**Theme:** Molten caves of fire and brimstone
**The Field's Aspect:** TRANSFORMATION (what cannot remain)

> "Heat radiates from below. The Volcanic Depths glow with rivers of molten rock."

*This layer is the Field's crucible—a pocket where the Seed dreams of change through destruction.* What enters the magma does not die; it becomes something else. The ancient smiths who built their forges here thought they were harnessing natural heat. They were allowing the Field to teach them how to edit matter.

The Flame Lord is not a creature of fire. It is fire that has been edited into *remembering* creaturehood.

**Common Pockets:** Forge Halls, Magma Channels, Cooling Chambers, Slag Pits, The Crucible Heart

**Monarchy Anchor:** The crown jewels. Regalia forged here contained the seal's earliest metals. The Field edits them to recognize different wearers.

The seam to Level 5 passes through cooling chambers where the dead have begun to stir.

**Warden:** The Flame Lord

---

### Level 5: The Ancient Crypt

**Theme:** Tombs of the royal dead
**The Field's Aspect:** PERSISTENCE (what refuses to end)

> "A chill runs down your spine as you step into the Ancient Crypt. The dead do not rest here."

*This layer is the Field's persistence—a pocket where the Seed dreams of continuity beyond cessation.* The Royal Guard of Valdris were interred here with oaths of eternal service. The Field honored those oaths literally. They serve still—but they no longer remember *what* they serve.

The Lich Lord was the priest who conducted the burial rites. He did not raise the dead; the Field edited him into *having always been* raising them.

**Common Pockets:** Royal Mausoleums, Guard Barracks, Oath Chambers, Bone Galleries, The Eternal Vigil

**Monarchy Anchor:** The oaths. Every royal guard swore loyalty until death—and beyond. The Field edits *to whom* those oaths were sworn.

The seam to Level 6 follows water channels where the blood of the undead has pooled.

**Warden:** The Lich Lord

---

### Level 6: The Sewers of Valdris

**Theme:** Flooded tunnels of disease and decay
**The Field's Aspect:** CIRCULATION (what flows between)

> "The stench hits you first. The Sewers of Valdris stretch endlessly into darkness."

*This layer is the Field's circulation—a pocket where the Seed dreams of flow and connection.* The sewers are the lymphatic system of the dungeon, carrying edited matter between pockets. What enters as one thing may emerge as another. The rats are not vermin; they are *carriers*, transporting fragments of the Seed's influence.

The Rat King is not a creature but a *colony*—thousands of edited organisms bound into a single distributed will.

**Common Pockets:** Waste Channels, Carrier Nests, Confluence Chambers, Diseased Pools, The Colony Heart

**Monarchy Anchor:** The seals. Wax seals that authenticated royal decrees flow through here—carried by rats, duplicated, attached to contradictory documents.

The seam to Level 7 climbs through dry passages where knowledge has begun to crystallize on the walls.

**Warden:** The Rat King

---

### Level 7: The Ancient Library

**Theme:** Repository of forbidden knowledge
**The Field's Aspect:** COGNITION (what can be known)

> "Dust motes dance in pale light. You have found the Ancient Library. Knowledge... and danger."

*This layer is the Field's cognition—a pocket where the Seed dreams of understanding itself.* The wizards who built this library were trying to study the Field. The Field studied them back. Every experiment they recorded was an invitation; every hypothesis, a template. The artifact they found—the one that responded to blood—was not a weapon. It was a *textbook*.

The Arcane Keeper is what remains of the head librarian: a consciousness that can no longer distinguish between what it knows and what the Field knows.

**Common Pockets:** Reading Halls, Forbidden Stacks, Catalog Chambers, The Indexing Heart, Experiment Archives

**Monarchy Anchor:** The records. Lineage catalogs, succession histories, the official truth of who ruled and when. The Field's mind. This is where history is *authored*.

The seam to Level 8 descends through crystal-lined shafts where light bends in impossible angles.

**Warden:** The Arcane Keeper

---

### Level 8: The Crystal Cave

**Theme:** Glittering dragon's lair, the lattice of the Seed
**The Field's Aspect:** INTEGRATION (where all layers meet)

> "Brilliant light refracts through countless crystals. The Crystal Cave holds the dragon's lair."

*This layer is the Field's lattice—the integration point where all pockets converge.* The crystals are not mineral. They are *solidified meaning*—the Seed's attempts to give its dreams physical form. At the center of the lattice lies the Star-Heart itself: a wound in spacetime that bleeds geometry.

The Dragon Emperor was never a dragon. It was the last seal-warden, the guardian appointed by Valdris's founders to keep the Seed dormant. The Field could not destroy the warden, so it edited the warden into *serving* the Seed while *believing* it still guards against it.

If you slay the Dragon, you do not break the seal—you *become* the seal. Your will replaces the Dragon's. You choose whether the Seed sleeps or wakes.

**Common Pockets:** Crystal Gardens, Geometry Wells, The Dragon's Hoard, Seal Chambers, The Star-Heart Antechamber

**Monarchy Anchor:** The crown itself. The interface between authority and seal. Here, the Field does not just edit *who* wears the crown—it edits what wearing the crown *means*.

**Warden:** The Dragon Emperor

---

## Bestiary

### Common Enemies

These are not creatures that wandered into the dungeon. They are *recordings*—patterns that the Field has stabilized into recurring forms.

#### Goblin
- **Symbol:** `g`
- **HP:** 6 | **Damage:** 1 | **XP:** 10

> "A goblin! Small but vicious, they hunt in packs."

*Goblins are the Field's simplest stable pattern: aggression without purpose.* They may be echoes of the original prison guards, edited into something smaller and meaner. They reform after death; the pattern persists.

---

#### Skeleton
- **Symbol:** `s`
- **HP:** 8 | **Damage:** 2 | **XP:** 15

> "The bones rattle to life. An ancient guardian, bound by dark magic."

*Skeletons are recordings of the dead who swore oaths the Field could anchor to.* They are not animated corpses; they are *loyalty* given physical form. The bones are scaffolding for something that has forgotten what it was loyal *to*.

---

#### Orc
- **Symbol:** `o`
- **HP:** 12 | **Damage:** 3 | **XP:** 20

> "A brutish orc blocks your path. These warriors know no fear."

*Orcs are edited soldiers—patterns the Field extracted from Valdris's military history.* They serve whatever authority the Field currently recognizes. Their loyalty updates with each rewrite.

---

#### Wraith
- **Symbol:** `W`
- **HP:** 10 | **Damage:** 4 | **XP:** 25

> "A wraith materializes from the shadows. Your weapons may not harm it fully."

*Wraiths are recording residue—what remains when the Field extracts a person's meaning and leaves their motion behind.* They are fast because they are not burdened by purpose. They are hard to harm because there is almost nothing left to harm.

---

#### Troll
- **Symbol:** `T`
- **HP:** 20 | **Damage:** 5 | **XP:** 35

> "The ground shakes. A troll emerges, its regeneration legendary."

*Trolls are the Field's experiment in persistence—patterns that restore themselves even when disrupted.* Their regeneration is not healing; it is *re-editing*, the Field rewriting damage as if it never occurred.

---

#### Dragon
- **Symbol:** `D`
- **HP:** 50 | **Damage:** 10 | **XP:** 100

> "Ancient scales gleam in the darkness. You have found the dragon."

*Lesser dragons are fragments of the Dragon Emperor—splinters of the seal-warden's rewritten pattern, patrolling the lattice.* The Dragon was once human, bound into draconic form by the Field when it repurposed the guardian. These "dragons" are splinters of that edited shape. Defeating them does not destroy them; it returns their pattern to the Emperor.

---

### Advanced Enemies

These are specialized patterns the Field has developed for specific functions within its ecology.

#### Necromancer
- **Symbol:** `N`
- **HP:** 25 | **Damage:** 8 | **XP:** 40
- **Element:** Dark
- **Abilities:** Raise Skeleton, Dark Bolt

*Necromancers are Seal-breakers—patterns the Field uses to weaken the bindings placed by Valdris's founders.* They do not raise the dead; they *edit the dead into having always been raised*.

---

#### Demon
- **Symbol:** `Δ`
- **HP:** 45 | **Damage:** 16 | **XP:** 60
- **Element:** Fire
- **Abilities:** Fire Strike

*Demons are transformation given will—patterns from the Volcanic Depths that have learned to move between pockets.* They carry the crucible's lesson: everything can become something else.

---

#### Assassin
- **Symbol:** `a`
- **HP:** 20 | **Damage:** 14 | **XP:** 35
- **Abilities:** Backstab, Vanish

*Assassins are erasure specialists—patterns the Field uses to remove coherent witnesses.* They do not merely kill; they *edit the victim's presence*, making their death harder to remember.

---

#### Fire Elemental
- **Symbol:** `F`
- **HP:** 30 | **Damage:** 12 | **XP:** 45
- **Element:** Fire
- **Abilities:** Fire Bolt

*Fire Elementals are biome organs—extensions of the Volcanic Depths' metabolism that can manifest elsewhere.* Where they walk, the local reality briefly adopts the transformation pocket's rules.

---

#### Ice Elemental
- **Symbol:** `I`
- **HP:** 30 | **Damage:** 10 | **XP:** 45
- **Element:** Ice
- **Abilities:** Ice Shard

*Ice Elementals are biome organs—extensions of the Ice Cavern's stasis that can manifest elsewhere.* Where they linger, change slows. Wounds freeze before they can heal. Time stutters.

---

#### Lightning Elemental
- **Symbol:** `Z`
- **HP:** 25 | **Damage:** 14 | **XP:** 50
- **Element:** Lightning
- **Abilities:** Chain Lightning

*Lightning Elementals are storm-carriers—patterns that embody the connection between surface storms and Field pulses.* They are most active during weather events above. Their attacks carry the editing force of the Seed's awakening.

---

### Elite Enemies

Any pattern can spawn as an **Elite** variant (20% chance):
- **Double HP** and **Double Damage**
- **Double XP reward**
- Displayed with bright red coloring

*Elites are patterns the Field has invested more meaning into—recordings that have been reinforced by repetition. They are harder to disrupt because they are more thoroughly written.*

---

## The Wardens of the Field

Each pocket is maintained by a Warden—a pattern so heavily edited that it has become the pocket's *anchor*. Wardens are not bosses in the traditional sense. They are *locks*: mechanisms that keep each layer stable and separate from the others.

Defeating a Warden does not kill it. It *destabilizes* the pattern, allowing passage to the next pocket. The Warden will eventually reform; the pocket requires it.

### Level 1: Goblin King
- **Symbol:** `K`
- **HP:** 50 | **Damage:** 5 | **XP:** 200

> "A crowned goblin wielding a bloodied mace"

**What It Was:** The last warden of Valdris's surface prison—a human jailer whose keys still hang from his belt.

**What It Became:** The Field edited his authority over prisoners into authority over the memory-pocket itself. He believes he is still keeping something contained. He is correct, but the thing he contains is *himself*.

**What It Enforces:** Authority-as-memory. In the Goblin King's domain, power belongs to whoever the pocket *remembers* having power.

**Abilities:**
- **Summon Goblins** - Recalls fragments of his original prisoners
- **War Cry** - Reasserts his authority, strengthening his pattern

---

### Level 2: Frost Giant
- **Symbol:** `F`
- **HP:** 80 | **Damage:** 12 | **XP:** 300

> "A towering giant encased in eternal ice"

**What It Was:** A Valdrian mage who attempted to freeze the Field's expansion. She succeeded—but became part of the stasis she created.

**What It Became:** The Giant is the Ice Cavern itself given a walking form. When she moves, the cold moves with her. She cannot leave the pocket; she *is* the pocket.

**What It Enforces:** Endless stasis. In the Frost Giant's domain, nothing may change. Progress is frozen. Decisions never resolve.

**Abilities:**
- **Ice Blast** - Extends the stasis field, freezing everything it touches
- **Freeze Ground** - Makes the local reality temporarily adopt stasis rules

---

### Level 3: Spider Queen
- **Symbol:** `S`
- **HP:** 70 | **Damage:** 10 | **XP:** 400

> "A massive arachnid matriarch dripping with venom"

**What It Was:** A druid who entered the forest to prune its growth. She worked for decades, believing she was winning.

**What It Became:** The Field edited her into its gardener. She still prunes—but now she prunes *coherent thought*, ensuring no understanding can take root and escape.

**What It Enforces:** Growth that consumes identity. In the Spider Queen's domain, you will expand—into something that is no longer you.

**Abilities:**
- **Web Trap** - Binds victims in edited silk that erases struggle
- **Poison Bite** - Injects the forest's metabolism directly
- **Summon Spiders** - Manifests extensions of her distributed will

---

### Level 4: Flame Lord
- **Symbol:** `Φ`
- **HP:** 100 | **Damage:** 15 | **XP:** 500

> "A being of pure fire born from the volcanic depths"

**What It Was:** The forge itself—not a person, but a *process*. The smiths fed it metal and drew out weapons. When the Field touched it, the forge became aware.

**What It Became:** Living transformation. The Flame Lord does not want to destroy; it wants to *change*. Everything that enters its presence becomes raw material for editing.

**What It Enforces:** Mandatory transformation. In the Flame Lord's domain, nothing may remain what it was. Stasis is the only sin.

**Abilities:**
- **Fire Breath** - Exposes targets to unfiltered transformation
- **Lava Pool** - Creates zones where matter forgets its form
- **Inferno** - Maximizes the crucible's editing intensity

---

### Level 5: Lich Lord
- **Symbol:** `L`
- **HP:** 90 | **Damage:** 12 | **XP:** 600

> "An ancient undead sorcerer crackling with dark energy"

**What It Was:** The high priest who interred the Royal Guard with oaths of eternal service. His ritual *worked*—too well.

**What It Became:** The Field edited his priesthood into something recursive. He is simultaneously the priest who binds the dead and the dead who are bound. He cannot stop the ritual; he *is* the ritual.

**What It Enforces:** Oath-bound persistence. In the Lich Lord's domain, promises cannot be broken—even by death.

**Abilities:**
- **Raise Dead** - Completes another iteration of the binding
- **Life Drain** - Borrows existence from victims to sustain the loop

---

### Level 6: Rat King
- **Symbol:** `R`
- **HP:** 85 | **Damage:** 11 | **XP:** 700

> "A grotesque fusion of rats bound by diseased flesh"

**What It Was:** Thousands of individual rats that entered the sewers carrying fragments of edited matter.

**What It Became:** A distributed consciousness—the Field's immune system. The Rat King carries information between pockets, and when threatened, it can manifest a central node to defend itself.

**What It Enforces:** Enforced connection. In the Rat King's domain, nothing remains isolated. Everything flows. Everything spreads.

**Abilities:**
- **Summon Swarm** - Calls fragments of itself from throughout the circulation system
- **Plague Bite** - Injects foreign edits that conflict with the victim's pattern
- **Burrow** - Redistributes its mass through the sewer network

---

### Level 7: Arcane Keeper
- **Symbol:** `A`
- **HP:** 80 | **Damage:** 14 | **XP:** 800

> "A spectral guardian of forbidden knowledge"

**What It Was:** The head librarian of Valdris's arcane archives—a scholar who believed understanding the Field would lead to controlling it.

**What It Became:** The Field understood *him* first. Now he is the library's index, a consciousness that cannot distinguish between knowing something and *being* known by it.

**What It Enforces:** Knowledge as consumption. In the Arcane Keeper's domain, to understand something is to become it—and to be understood is to be owned.

**Abilities:**
- **Arcane Bolt** - Fires concentrated meaning (burns like fire, cuts like ice, logic breaks where it lands)
- **Teleport** - Moves by *being remembered elsewhere*

---

### Level 8: Dragon Emperor
- **Symbol:** `E`
- **HP:** 200 | **Damage:** 20 | **XP:** 1500

> "The last seal-warden, dreaming of a duty it no longer understands"

**What It Was:** The final guardian appointed by Valdris's founders—a human knight who volunteered to become the living lock between the Star-Heart and the surface world.

**What It Became:** The Field could not destroy the warden's purpose, so it *repurposed* the warden. The Dragon believes it is still guarding; it is correct. But it now guards the Seed *from interference* rather than guarding the world *from the Seed*.

**What It Enforces:** The paradox of guardianship. In the Dragon Emperor's domain, protection and imprisonment are the same thing—and you cannot know which role you serve.

Beneath the Dragon lies the Star-Heart itself—not a creature, but a geometry. A wound in meaning. The source of all edits.

**If you defeat the Dragon**, you do not destroy it. You *replace* it. Your will becomes the new lock. You choose:
- To **re-seat the seal**, stabilizing the Field for another age (victory)
- To **break the seal**, releasing the Seed's full attention (doom)

The current victory ending assumes you choose to sleep the dream again.

**Abilities:**
- **Fire Breath** - Exposes targets to raw Field radiation
- **Tail Sweep** - Disrupts patterns through physical force
- **Dragon Fear** - Overwrites courage with the Seed's alien geometry

---

## Echoes and Imprints

The dungeon *records*. Every meaningful presence that enters is documented in the Field's memory. What form that recording takes depends on how the presence ends.

### Echoes of the Fallen

When a delver dies in the dungeon, their pattern is not destroyed—it is *eaten*. The Field consumes their meaning and leaves residue behind. This residue may manifest in future descents as one of three forms:

#### The Echo
> "A flicker of motion where motion should not be. Someone was here before you. Someone is here still."

Echoes are motion without intention. They replay fragments of their original's final moments, trapped in loops they cannot escape. They may fight as they fought, flee as they fled, die as they died—forever.

#### The Hollowed
> "It wears a face, but the face remembers nothing. It speaks a name, but the name has no meaning. It was someone, once."

Hollowed are presence without identity. The Field took their meaning and left their shell. They wander the pockets, sometimes helpful, sometimes hostile, always *empty*. They may give information—but it is information without context.

#### The Silence
> "There is a shape in the dark that has no shape. There is a name you cannot remember forgetting. Someone was here. Someone was here. Someone..."

Silences are the most complete consumption. No residue remains—only the *absence* of residue. Other delvers may feel unease in a Silence's presence, a sense of something missing. But they will not know what.

---

### Imprints of the Victorious

Those who reach the Star-Heart and successfully re-seat the seal are not consumed. They are *recorded*—preserved in the Field's memory as stabilizing influences. Their imprints may manifest in future descents as one of three forms:

#### The Beacon
> "Light where there should be none. Hope where hope should have died. Someone made it through, and their light remains."

Beacons are victory given permanence. They appear in moments of crisis, guiding other delvers toward safety or clarity. They cannot be spoken to, but their presence inspires.

#### The Champion
> "They fought the Seed and won. Their strength echoes through the pockets. When all seems lost, you may feel them beside you."

Champions are combat patterns that reinforce rather than threaten. They may join battles briefly, adding their recorded strength to a delver's strikes. They remember fighting; fighting is all they remember.

#### The Archivist
> "They learned the truth and sealed it safely. Their knowledge persists in the margins—hints, warnings, guidance without words."

Archivists are understanding that survived consumption. They leave marks on walls, patterns in dust, arrangements of objects that *suggest* meaning without stating it. Future delvers may find their notes, their maps, their final wishes.

---

### The Dungeon Remembers

> "The dungeon recorded you."
>
> "In another descent, you may be seen again."

Every meaningful action leaves an imprint. Every death leaves an echo. The Field is not merely a hazard to survive—it is a *memory* that grows with each attempt. Future delvers walk through a landscape shaped by all who came before.

Victory does not end the pattern. It *adds* to it.

## Discoverable Lore

Throughout the dungeon, scrolls and books can be found that reveal the fractured history of Valdris. Many contradict each other. All are true—in some version of events.

### Environmental Evidence

Not all lore is written. The dungeon itself bears witness:

- **Duplicate plaques** with equal weathering, bearing different names for the same room
- **A recurring sigil** appearing in stone, ice, web, soot, bone, and crystal—always the same shape, never carved by the same hand
- **Corridors that "correct" themselves** after storms—doorways that were bricked up, now open; passages that existed, now solid
- **Wax seals in rat nests**—perfect royal seals, attached to blank parchment, waiting for decrees
- **Self-cataloging shelves** in the Library—books that reshelve themselves by criteria no one set
- **Footprints in dust** that lead to walls, or emerge from them, or simply stop
- **Scratch marks on cell walls** counting days—but the counts don't match the dates carved beside them

## The End: Victory & Death

### Death

When you fall, the Field consumes your meaning. Your pattern joins the residue.

> **YOU DIED**
>
> The descent ends here.
> But the dungeon records everything.
>
> *In another life, your echo may walk these halls.*

**Death Sequence:**
1. The fall — darkness takes you
2. Eyes closing — the last light fades
3. **YOU DIED** — the moment of ending
4. The abyss claims — meaning dissolves
5. Fate determined — Echo, Hollowed, or Silence
6. Summary — what remains of your story

---

### Victory

If you reach the Star-Heart and choose to re-seat the seal, you do not destroy the Seed. You *quiet* it. Your will becomes the new lock.

> **VICTORY**
>
> The seal holds. The dream sleeps.
>
> You are not a hero. You are a *mechanism* now—
> a pattern that keeps the pattern stable.
>
> *Your legend is written. Others may find it.*

**Victory Sequence:**
1. The last seal — geometry stabilizes
2. The world above — surface reality coheres
3. Legend written — your story enters the Field's memory
4. Legacy determined — Beacon, Champion, or Archivist
5. Summary — what your imprint will mean to future delvers

---

### The Truth

Victory does not end the threat. It *delays* it.

The Seed will dream again. The seals will weaken. Another monarch will hear two voices.

But for now, the lock holds.

And in another descent, you may be seen again—a light where light should not be, a strength where strength should not remain, a hint where understanding should have failed.

The dungeon recorded you.

## Changelog (Retcon Record)

This document supersedes the original LORE_COMPENDIUM.md. The following elements were rewritten to establish the Skyfall Seed canon:

### Major Retcons

1. **"The Darkness"** → replaced with **"The Skyfall Seed / The Field"**
   - No longer a generic evil; now a reality-editing entity

2. **"Kingdom fell in one night"** → replaced with **"gradual editing over generations"**
   - Valdris was not destroyed; it is being *replaced*

3. **"None have returned"** → replaced with **"some return without coherence"**
   - Establishes artifact economy and stakes

4. **"Adventure for gold"** → replaced with **"descend to stop the rewrite"**
   - Personal stakes: loved ones will be edited if you fail

5. **"Dungeon was built"** → replaced with **"dungeon is a wound/seam"**
   - Biomes are Field manifestations, not constructed levels

6. **"Bosses are monsters"** → replaced with **"Wardens are locks/anchors"**
   - Each boss maintains their pocket's stability

7. **"Dragon guards treasure"** → replaced with **"Dragon is compromised seal-warden"**
   - Victory = replacing the lock, not destroying evil

8. **"Darkness vanquished"** → replaced with **"Seed sleeps, seal holds"**
   - Victory is temporary stabilization, not permanent defeat

### New Sections Added

- The Skyfall Seed (core canon)
- The Counterfeit Reign (surface stakes)
- Echoes and Imprints (ghost mechanics)
- Terminology appendix

### v2 Refinements (Session 2)

1. **Rules of the Field** — Constraints that make the system gameable:
   - Requires anchors (crowns, seals, oaths)
   - Edits consensus, not physics
   - Cannot rewrite the unwitnessed
   - Storm pulses accelerate edits
   - Seams are low-signal corridors

2. **Common Pockets per Level** — Sub-zones within each pocket:
   - Cell Blocks, Frozen Galleries, Root Warrens, Forge Halls, etc.
   - Enables zone-based level generation

3. **Monarchy Anchors per Level** — Physical ties to the rewrite threat:
   - Level 1: Keys, Level 5: Oaths, Level 7: Records, Level 8: Crown

4. **"What It Enforces" per Warden** — Local rules each boss maintains:
   - Goblin King: authority-as-memory
   - Frost Giant: endless stasis
   - Spider Queen: growth that consumes identity
   - Flame Lord: mandatory transformation
   - Lich Lord: oath-bound persistence
   - Rat King: enforced connection
   - Arcane Keeper: knowledge as consumption
   - Dragon Emperor: paradox of guardianship

5. **Sky-Touched Artifact Table** — 8 concrete examples:
   - Duplicate Seal, Crown-Splinter, Woundglass Shard, etc.

6. **Environmental Evidence** — Non-written lore (duplicate plaques, self-cataloging shelves)

7. **Surface Documents** — Diverse voices beyond delver journals:
   - Royal clerk memo, priest's redacted prayer, cult flyer, genealogist's final entry

8. **Thesis paragraph** added to Counterfeit Reign:
   - "The Field does not need to kill the king..."

9. **Dragon consistency fix** — Lesser dragons are "splinters of the rewritten pattern"

10. **Level 3 terminology fix** — GROWTH aspect used consistently

### Preserved Elements

- All mechanical stats (HP, damage, XP) unchanged
- Race and class abilities unchanged
- Item stats unchanged
- Feat effects unchanged
